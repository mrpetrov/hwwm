Writing a value between 9 and 12 to the sysfs w1_slave file will change the precision of the sensor for the next readings. This value is in (volatile) SRAM, so it is reset when the sensor gets power-cycled.

To store the current precision configuration into EEPROM, the value 0 has to be written to the sysfs w1_slave file. Since the EEPROM has a limited amount of writes (>50k), this command should be used wisely.
