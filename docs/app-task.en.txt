Task: to develop software to make decisions for the control of 2 pumps, a valve, an electric heater and a heat pump system based on the information about the ambient temperature and the water in the installation in several key places

Scheme of hybrid heating installation:

The installation consists of a solid fuel boiler, a boiler with two coils, a draining solar collector, a heat pump installation.
There are two water pumps - one supplies cold water to the boiler inlet, and the other moves the water in the solar collector.
The heating of the water in the boiler is possible through the solar collector, the water from the boiler - through a valve, and directly through an electric heater.

The software must make decisions for the control of the valve, the pumps, the electric heater and the preparation of commands for the heat pump system.

The aim is to pursue 2 goals - the desired temperature of the water in the boiler and the desired temperature of the water coming out of the boiler.

For the target water temperature from the boiler, the system will use a table with intermediate hourly temperatures, and the final target temperature is calculated by subtracting the ambient temperature from the intermediate hourly temperature.

The intermediate temperatures by hours from 0 to 23 are as follows:
38, 36, 36, 36, 36, 38, 40, 40, 40, 40, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 43, 40

Thus, for example at an ambient 5 ° C in 0 hours the final target joint becomes:
goal = 38 - 5
target = 33 ° C

At ambient -5 ° C in 0 hours the final target joint:
target = 38 - (-5)
target = 43 ° C

The system has information about the power of each of the controls, as well as the maximum allowable power (configurable).

The purpose of the controller is to reach the target temperatures in the most economical way possible.

The controller must read the temperatures from the sensors at least once a minute, and either store this information locally or send it to a remote system.

In order to make better management decisions, temperature readings can be done more often - as long as the sensors allow it.

Controller operating modes:
• heating the boiler through the panel;
• heating the boiler through the boiler;
• heating of the electric boiler;
• heating of the boiler installation through the panel / boiler;
• emergency heat transfer - the valve opens, the collector pump is activated
• boiler accident:
  • - the temperature of the fluid leaving the boiler is> = 80 + ° C - a message is sent;
  • - if the temperatures of the other bodies are normal - emergency heat transfer is activated;
• boiler accident:
  • - the water temperature in the boiler is> = 88 ° C - a message is sent;
  • - if the temperatures of the other bodies are normal - emergency heat transfer is activated;
• crash panel:
  • - the temperature of the fluid in the collector is> = 100 ° C - a message is sent;
  • - the temperature of the fluid in the collector is <= 5 ° C - a message is sent;
  • - if the temperatures of the other bodies are normal - emergency heat transfer is activated;
• off / waiting:
  • - the required water temperature in the boiler has been reached, there are no accidents
