## GPIO     input section

# BCM number of GPIO pin, from which to read current power source, by default BCM 7, RPi header pin 26
# if this pin is held at logical 1 (pull-up 3.3V) - it means the system is battery backup powered, 0 is grid power

## GPIO     output section

# Instruct the daemon to invert the GPIO pins controlling signals - disabled with zero, enabled on non-zero
# NOTE: only the out state is inverted -  internal and logged states remain the same: 1 is for ON, 0 is for OFF
# default value: INVERTED

# BCM number of GPIO pin, controlling boiler electrical heater power, by default BCM 16, RPi header pin 36
el_heater_pin=16

# BCM number of GPIO pin, used as comms pin 1, by default BCM 17, RPi header pin 11

## Sensors config section

# NOTE: in warnings and errors with sensors, sensors are numbered as follows:
# 1 = furnace; 2 = solar collector; 3 = boiler high; 4 = boiler low; 5 = environment

# path to read furnace temp sensor data from
tkotel_sensor=/dev/zero/1

# path to read evacuated tube collector temps sensor data from
tkolektor_sensor=/dev/zero/2

# path to read  boiler high temps sensor data from
tboilerh_sensor=/dev/zero/3

# path to read  boiler low temps sensor data from
tboilerl_sensor=/dev/zero/4

# path to read  environment temps sensor data from
tenv_sensor=/dev/zero/5
